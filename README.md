## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd stock-analysis-app
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory by copying the `.env.example` file.
    -   ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Add your API key for Finnhub to the `.env` file.

## üèÉ Running the Application

As per the project's development workflow, the application should be built for production and then served manually.

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles the application and places the optimized build artifacts in the `frontend/dist` directory.

2.  **Serve the production build:**
    You can use any static file server to serve the contents of the `frontend/dist` directory. A common tool for this is `serve`.
    ```bash
    # If you don't have serve, install it globally
    npm install -g serve

    # Serve the dist directory
    serve -s dist
    ```
    The application will then be available at the URL provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## üîë Environment Variables

To run this application, you need to provide the following environment variable in a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

-   `VITE_FINNHUB_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Finnhub.io service.

See `.env.example` for a template.
