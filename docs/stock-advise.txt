Table 2 shows that linear regression model performs well as compared to SVM Model. Hence,
linear regression model was used to determine the future trend since it was more accurate.
Figure 3 shows the prediction of the future trend for the next 30 days.
4.2.2 Analysis of algorithms used to determine whether to Buy or Sell:
Bollinger Bands:
Bollinger bands are basically volatility bands placed above and below the moving average of
the data.
Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6 show various trends using Bollinger bands. If closing price is
above the upper band, the stock may be shorted, otherwise it is a good time to position stocks.
Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD):
Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9 show various trends using MACD which is used as an indicator
to trade trends based on signal line. Trading is done if MACD line intersects signal line.
Money Flow Index (MFI):
Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12 show various trends using MFI. It is used to find overbought
or oversold signals in an asset as well as spot divergences in price. The value of MFI more than eighty
and less than twenty is assumed as oversold.

Relative Strength Index (RSI):
Figure 13 and Figure 14 show various trends using for RIL. The stock is usually understood
overbought when the RSI is more than seventy percent and oversold when it is lower than thirty percent.
4.2.3 Sentiment Analysis of Earning Call (EC)/ Annual General Meet (AGM) Analysis:
Earnings call 1 (April 2020) and AGM 2 are conference calls. During the call, the management
comments on the company’s financials like venue generated, profits, new projects, futures, etc. It

is a very important transcript which not only emphasizes numbers but also states the reason behind
those numbers. Therefore, it can determine conditions for investors to trust or not on their equity.
Table 3 lists findings of sentiment analysis of both scripts
4.2.4 Balance Sheet (BS) and Income Statement Analysis (IS):
The balance sheet is the most important document that is provided by the company. It determines
the present conditions as well as the company’s future growth potential. The most important factors
of the balance sheet are analyzed that assist traders not only to determine how strong the company’s
current financial position is, but also whether investing in the company right now can be a profitable

move or not. The financial data is extracted from the financial modeling “Prep” using their API.
After analyzing the BS and the IS statements of RIL, it is found that the revenue grew at a rate of
26% for the past two years.
Table 4 shows results of in-depth analysis by computing Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC) and Debt-to-Equity ratio (D/E ratio), and Net Present Value (NPV).
This is a good signal as it shows the company is coming out from its problems and strengthening
itself. This can also be seen in the stock price as it grew from Rs 867/- to Rs. 1844/- (112.6%) between
April 2020 and July 2020.
Since generally Debt<WACC<Equity(20%) therefore we can expect a minimum of 15% returns
on investment on buying the RIL Share which is a fair deal for the retail investor. Since Debt/Equity

ratio is in between (0, 1) which means the company does not rely only on debt and has low solvency
risk. This is a good indication. This means that even after paying 15% over equity the company has
a huge corpus for investing in projects and assets. This is also a positive indication.
If the revenue growth, perpetuity growth and cost of capital are 26%, 15% and 0.05% respectively,
the forecasted price of the stock is calculated as 3228.778.
This means keeping a long-term gain of 26% every year today the stock value can be 3228.77
purchased. The current stock price is Rs. 1958/- which means the stock is currently undervalued and
buying can be considered.

The ROE for RIL is computed as per the DuPont analysis using (1) and obtained as 0.129, 0.1163,
and 0.0936 for years 2018, 2019, 2020 respectively.
ROE = Profitability * Tech Efficiency * Financial Structure (1)
The past Return on Equity (ROE) is very good for RIL But since the IS and BS are provided in
March of every month, so this calculation is till March 2020. The stock price of RIL grew by 104%
between March and today so a better BS and IS are anticipated.
Moreover, this data can be useful in determining internal operations within the company. Since
the financial structure aspect of the formula is always nearly constant this means that the company is

not relying upon debt to boost ROE hence a fair practice can be concluded. This is a good indication
as the money invested by the investors will be safe.
4.2.5 Stock recommendation and Trade assistance
Table 5 shows analysis of the various financial factors. It can be concluded that the investors can
consider buying RIL equity.

5. CoNCLUSIoN
The stock market due to its highly volatile nature is an uncertain place for investment for any new
or seasoned investor but the returns it provides cannot be ignored. Due to this same reason, many
individuals invest in the stock market, but this level of uncertainty is also huge. So, there is a need for
a system that can help investors in gaining high returns and possess a low risk. To put it all together,
the detailed analysis and experimentation carried out by us raises the conclusion that the model we
have implemented is a highly accurate one in predicting the price of a stock for the next day as well
as in predicting the price trend of the same stock. The financial indicators which are included in
making the model have proved to be a major success as they have helped in creating trade assistance
which will help the investor in making decisions regarding the stock’s trade-off and maximizing
their profits. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis of earning calls and annual general meetings has
helped in gaining meaningful insight into a company’s present and future which may affect its stock
price. The in-depth balance sheet and income statement analysis have also helped in creating a more
accurate model that minimizes the chances of loss and maximizes the chances of gaining profits in
the stock market.
Even with a great study of a particular script, there is a fair chance of losing value on that
script due to the volatile and risk-abating nature of the stock market. News sentiment analysis can
sometimes play an important role in stock trend prediction and is not feasible due to no backdated
data for stocks listed on NSE
