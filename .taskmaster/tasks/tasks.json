The current subtask is about comparing chart components to identify any that serve the same purpose or have similar functionality, which is a crucial step before consolidating them as per the parent task's objective.\n\nThe user request outlines several key points regarding the current state of chart components in the project, including identified redundancies, component usage analysis, and a proposed consolidation strategy. \n\n1. **Identified Redundancies and Issues**: The user has identified major redundancy between `StockChart.tsx` and `AdvancedStockChart.tsx`, as both utilize Chart.js for price visualization and serve similar purposes despite some differences in features. Additionally, `InteractiveChart.tsx` is currently disabled due to integration issues, despite having professional trading features.\n\n2. **Component Usage Analysis**: The analysis shows that `ChartSelector.tsx` manages switching between different chart types and needs simplification after consolidation. `IndicatorChart.tsx` is a separate component for displaying technical indicators using Chart.js and could be integrated into the main chart component.\n\n3. **App.tsx Integration**: The current integration in `App.tsx` imports multiple chart components and manages their display based on a `chartType` state. However, there's a contradiction since the default `chartType` is 'interactive', but `InteractiveChart` is disabled.\n\n4. **Consolidation Strategy**: The proposed strategy involves merging redundant components, fixing or replacing `InteractiveChart` functionality, integrating `IndicatorChart` capabilities into the main chart, and simplifying `ChartSelector` to manage a single chart component.\n\nGiven this context, the new information that should be appended to the subtask's details is a summary or direct inclusion of the details provided in the user request, as it directly pertains to the outcome of comparing chart components and outlines the next steps for consolidation.\n\nThe new text to be added should directly reflect the findings and the proposed strategy as outlined in the user request.\n\nDUPLICATES AND REDUNDANCIES IDENTIFIED: Primary Redundancy Issues: 1. StockChart.tsx vs AdvancedStockChart.tsx - MAJOR REDUNDANCY, both use Chart.js for price visualization, StockChart: Simple line chart, AdvancedStockChart: Enhanced with candlestick simulation, same data format requirements and similar Chart.js configuration. 2. InteractiveChart.tsx - DISABLED DUE TO ISSUES, uses lightweight-charts library, commented out in App.tsx. Component Usage Analysis: 1. ChartSelector.tsx - Configuration UI, manages switching between chart types, needs simplification after consolidation. 2. IndicatorChart.tsx - Technical Indicators, uses Chart.js independently, could be integrated into main chart component. App.tsx Integration: Currently imports multiple chart components, uses chartType state, default chartType is 'interactive' but component is disabled. Consolidation Strategy: 1. Merge StockChart + AdvancedStockChart into unified component, 2. Fix or replace InteractiveChart functionality, 3. Integrate IndicatorChart capabilities into main chart, 4. Simplify ChartSelector to manage single chart component.\n</info added on 2025-06-22T18:40:53.978Z>",

TypeScript Validation Results: Compilation Status: PASSED (0 errors), Code Quality: All type safety checks passing, Import/Export: All modules properly linked. Testing Infrastructure Ready: Technical indicator testing framework operational, Advanced caching service type-safe, All components properly typed and validated. Next Steps: Runtime testing to check for console warnings during actual usage.\n</info added on 2025-06-22T19:48:01.804Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-22T19:50:51.777Z>\nConsole Error Audit and Cleanup Progress: \n✅ COMPLETED - Main App.tsx Console Cleanup: \n- Removed all debug console.log statements from core functionality\n- Kept essential console.warn and console.error for debugging\n- Removed chart configuration logs, analysis logs, real-time update logs\n- Removed ML analysis, risk analytics, news loading debug logs\n- One remaining console.log in technical indicator test function (acceptable for dev tools)\n✅ COMPLETED - Console Audit Results: \n- Found extensive logging in service files (stockDataService.ts, serviceHealthTracker.ts, recommendationService.ts, etc.)\n- Most are intentional logging for debugging API issues and service health\n- Error and warning logs should remain for production debugging\n- Info/debug logs in main App.tsx successfully removed\n🎯 STATUS: Production-ready console cleanup completed for main application logic. Service-level logging preserved for operational monitoring.\n</info added on 2025-06-22T19:50:51.777Z>",
